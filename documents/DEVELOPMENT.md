# Developments: 
## 12/3/2020: 
We started the project today. We spent some time planning the classes/implementation for the project. Then we split up the work into three even parts. Each person has their assigned task to finish.
We are currently working on processing the data in the graphs and starting to figure out how to approach the algorithms assigned to each person.
The creation of the graph along with its edges should theoretically work,
although we haven't tested it yet.
## 12/7/2020: 
Started writing individual algorithms. Anthony finished the implementation of
Djkistras algorithm but hasn't tested it yet. Kyle also finished the
implemenetation for strongly connected components using Tarjan's algorithm. Brandon finished implementing the BFS traversal. We
also added a test.cpp for testing purposes.
## 12/10/2020:
We spent today testing the functions and cleaning up code. Anthony finished testing dijkstras algorithm and implemented the functions to use it.
Created way for the results to be exported via text files. Kyle added a way to
get the strongly connected components for either a chosen airline or all
airlines. It was also at this moment that he realized that the algorithm
doesn't really work, and after many hours of debugging and trying to see
what's wrong with the implementation of Tarjan's algorithm inspired by
GeeksForGeeks, he did not figure out why it wasn't working but it's okay since
he made a very good effort. Brandon finished testing the BFS traversal alongside implementing functions to export the traversal in to a text file.
## 12/11/2020: 
We finished the final versions of all the code and formatted each file, and also edited the README.md to meet the requirements. Kyle created doxygen documentation for the files.
