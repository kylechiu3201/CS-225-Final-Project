We started the project today. We spent some time planning the classes/implementation for the project. Then we split up the work into three even parts. Each person has their assigned task to finish.
We are currently working on processing the data in the graphs and starting to figure out how to approach the algorithms assigned to each person.
The creation of the graph along with its edges should theoretically work,
although we haven't tested it yet.

Started writing individual algorithms. Anthony finished the implementation of
Djkistras algorithm but hasn't tested it yet. Kyle also finished the
implemenetation for strongly connected components using Tarjan's algorithm. We
also added a test.cpp for testing purposes.
