## The Data
The breadth first search data is available in `REPLACE WITH FILE NAME OF BFS DATA`. The shortest path data is available in `REPLACE WITH FILE NAME OF SHORTEST PATH DATA`. The strongly connected components data is available in `allAirlinesNeeded.txt`. 
## Outcome Of Project
SOMEONE SUMMARIZE OUTCOME HERE (results were fine besides the Tarjan's hiccup, my in-degree of zero thing worked fine though)
## Discoveries Made
### BFS Discoveries
BRANDON ADD SOMEFIN OR DELETE THIS LINE AND THE PREVIOUS LINE

### Strongly Connected Components Discoveries
While there weren't any shocking discoveries, I was a bit surprised at how many airports did not have any vertices with an in-degree of zero, which is good since this means that they have wide availability for their customers. 
## Individual Results
### BFS Results
BRANDON ADD RESULTS
### Shortest Path Results
ANTHONY ADD RESULTS
### Strongly Connected Components Results
Although we weren't able to get the strongly connected components, we were able to get all vertices with an in-degree of zero, meaning that we have all airports of a chosen airline of which there is no way to get to that airport via that same chosen airline.<br/>
So with this, we were able to get a list of all airlines along with a list of all airports that each respective airline needs to add a route to in order to maximize the airline's availability to their customers.
